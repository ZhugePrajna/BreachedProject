# What is BreachedProject?

BreachedProject is Zhuge Prajna's personal "settings" project

The project aims to deny advertising information provided by the Internet

And provide more efficient "settings" operation/text

# How should I use these items?

First, you need to enter the project you want to use and view "readme.txt".

Then, you may want to know what is in the "[]" in front of "readme.txt".

So I will tell you:
  W stands for WindowsOS,
  L stands for LinuxOS,
  A is for MacOS (I can’t write about this! Because I don’t have the money to buy it!)
  U stands for Ancient OS (actually I don’t know what it is)

Finally, match the settings you want based on your OS and do it by yourself!

# Is there any Chinese introduction?

Yes, there are instructions in Chinese.

But, I'm lazy!

# How many projects are there in BreachedProject?

If you ask me, I don’t know either XD

# Can I also join this project?

sure!

We need humans who like to challenge themselves!
